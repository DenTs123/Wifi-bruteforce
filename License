------------------------------
A brute-force attack is a trial-and-error method used by application 
programs to decode login information and encryption keys to use them to gain 
unauthorized access to systems. 
Using brute force is an exhaustive effort rather than employing intellectual strategies.

Just as a criminal might break into and crack a safe by trying many 
possible combinations, a brute-force attack of applications tries all 
possible combinations of legal characters in a sequence. 
Cybercriminals typically use a brute-force attack to obtain 
access to a website, account or network. 
They may then install malware, shut down web applications or conduct data breaches.
