    !!!WARNING!!!

    PLEASE READ THIS!!!

    A brute-force attack is a trial-and-error method used by
    application
    programs to decode login information and encryption keys to use them to gain 
    unauthorized access to systems. 
    Using brute force is an exhaustive effort rather than employing intellectual strategies.

    Just as a criminal might break into and crack a safe by trying many 
    possible combinations, a brute-force attack of applications tries all 
    possible combinations of legal characters in a sequence. 
    Cybercriminals typically use a brute-force attack to obtain 
    access to a website, account or network. 
    They may then install malware, shut down web applications or conduct data breaches.

    PLEASE USE THIS PROGRAM ONLY FOR GOOD!

## After reading launch the Wifi brutforce menu and start the wifi bruteforce program
## If you don't install requirements the window will closed
## Or if you install all, this window should appear:
![Wifi bruteforce](Photos_for_README/Wifi%20bruteforce.png)
## On this photo you can see targets with numbers, strenght and SSID of wifi
## You must choose the target (input only â„– of Wifi)
## Confirm, and click Enter
## Then we must input the filename of our textfile with passwords
## To use deafult lib that was downloaded with program input "Cracklib.txt" (with format!)
## Click Enter and wait
## If password is true the program closed and connect you to the Wifi
# How to crack Wifi using the generated passwords?
## Generated passwords stored in file "passwords.txt"
## Input "passwords.txt" instead of "Cracklib.txt"
