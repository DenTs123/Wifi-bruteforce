Before we can start read this license:
***
    !!!WARNING!!!

    PLEASE READ THIS!!!

    A brute-force attack is a trial-and-error method used by
    application
    programs to decode login information and encryption keys to use them to gain 
    unauthorized access to systems. 
    Using brute force is an exhaustive effort rather than employing intellectual strategies.

    Just as a criminal might break into and crack a safe by trying many 
    possible combinations, a brute-force attack of applications tries all 
    possible combinations of legal characters in a sequence. 
    Cybercriminals typically use a brute-force attack to obtain 
    access to a website, account or network. 
    They may then install malware, shut down web applications or conduct data breaches.

    PLEASE USE THIS PROGRAM ONLY FOR GOOD!
***
After reading launch the Wifi brutforce menu and start the wifi bruteforce program
If you don't install requirements the window will closed
Or if you install all, this window should appear:

On this photo you can see targets with numbers, strenght and SSID of wifi
You must choose the target (input only â„– of Wifi)
Confirm, and click Enter
Then we must input the filename of our textfile with passwords
To use deafult lib that was downloaded with program input "Cracklib.txt" (with format!)
Click Enter and wait
